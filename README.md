# Morris Merch

This web app is meant to be a store for my high school where they can buy spirit-wear and merch. It evolved into a video game tradestop
but went back to the shop. Still working out kinks and is a work in development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This is a Python 3 project and requires the latest version of Python, a package manager, and a virtual environment.

### Installing
