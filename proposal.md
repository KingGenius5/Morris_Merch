I'm going to be creating an online store for my high school.
This store will streamline all sales of my school's spirit wear/club merch and have
a way to track where all the money is going as in to help budget things better (create a paper trail).
Having a central location for this allows clubs/organizations to better
put themselves out there and sell their products/ideas. On the authentication side, I'd need to make sure they were a student or staff member working at the school based on their login credentials. On the authorization side, students should be able to buy and checkout items, club leaders should be able to add items/delete ONLY to their club, and teachers/principals should be able to have admin access and do anything.
