I'm going to be creating an online store for my high school.
This store will streamline all sales of my school's spirit wear and have
a way to track where all the money is going to help budget things better.
Having a central location for this allows clubs/organizations to better
put themselves out there and sell their products/ideas. What I'm also
considering is since there is an Admin side, this allows the leaders
of each club to edit their own page on the store.
